# ClemWin

A lightweight window manager for Windows.

## Features

### Cool Layout Management

- Save up to 10 different layouts (positions, sizes, and states)
- Restore layouts with hotkeys
- Works over multiple monitors
- Works with restarts

### Search, Search, Search!

- Quickly find and switch to any open window
- Real-time search results as you type
- Smartly weighted: process name > window title > file name > path
- Looks like shit but that's how I like it

### Silent..ish?

- Runs quietly in the system tray
- Minimal resource usage when idle
- Search window couldn't be more in-your-face

## Usage

Run the binary to start the application.
If you want to, add it to startup programs.

### Hotkeys

#### Layouts

- **Win+Alt+[0-9]**: Save the current window layout to slot 0-9
- **Win+Ctrl+[0-9]**: Restore window layout from slot 0-9

#### Search

- **Win+Ctrl+K** or **Win+Shift+K**: Open the search overlay
- **Escape**: Cancel
- **Enter**: Focus the first search result
- Type to search for windows by title, process name, file, or even path

If the Win + K hotkey is not occupied by Windows casting, you can use it as well.

### System Tray

It's pretty much as it looks.
