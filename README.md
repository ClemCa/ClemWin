# ClemWin

A lightweight window manager for Windows.

## Features

### Cool Layout Management

- Save up to 10 different layouts (positions, sizes, and states)
- Restore layouts with hotkeys
- Works over multiple monitors
- Works with restarts
- Smart enough to find the closest matching window if the original doesn't exist anymore (e.g. your previous browser window was closed but you opened a new one)

### Search, Search, Search!

- Quickly find and switch to any open window
- Real-time search results as you type
- Smartly weighted: process name > window title > file name > path
- Looks like shit but that's how I like it

### Silent..ish?

- Runs quietly in the system tray
- Minimal resource usage when idle
- Search window and whitelist markers couldn't be more in-your-face

## Usage

Run the binary to start the application.
If you want to, add it to startup programs.

### Whitelisting

Whitelisting allows you to tell the program which windows to pay attention to.
When whitelisting is active, any window outside the list is ignored, be it for saving new layouts or applying existing ones.

#### Markers

When the whitelist is updated, markers are displayed on the bottom right corner of visible windows for a few seconds to indicate the changes.

A list of all whitelisted windows is also shown on the right side of the main display.

#### Persistence

Unlike layouts, the whitelist is not saved between sessions, and the app won't try to find back the closest matching window.

### Hotkeys

#### Layouts

- **Win+Alt+[0-9]**: Save the current window layout to slot 0-9
- **Win+Ctrl+[0-9]**: Restore window layout from slot 0-9

#### Search

- **Win+Ctrl+K** or **Win+Shift+K**: Open the search overlay
- **Escape**: Cancel
- **Enter**: Focus the first search result
- Type to search for windows by title, process name, file, or even path

If the Win + K hotkey is not occupied by Windows casting, you can use it as well.

#### Whitelist

- **Ctrl+Shift+Enter**: Toggle the current window in and out of the whitelist. If the whitelist mode is inactive, enables it.
- **Ctrl+Alt+Enter**: Wipe the whitelist, switching out of whitelist mode.

### System Tray

It's pretty much as it looks.
